# GestureXpress

GestureXpress is an innovative Kotlin-based Android application that leverages machine learning for hand gesture recognition. With GestureXpress, users can perform various actions through predefined hand gestures and clicks, allowing for a seamless and intuitive user experience with system navigation.

## Permissions

To use GestureXpress, please enable the following permissions:

- **Storage**: To save and access captured images and music files.
- **Camera**: To capture images and perform camera-related functions.

  
## Features

- **Hand Gesture Recognition**: Uses a machine learning model to recognize hand gestures.
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through different app options such as Torch, Camera, Gallery, Music Player, and Calendar.
- **Camera Functionality**: Capture images with a shutter button and timer functionality.
- **Music Player**: Includes an audio visualizer, play/pause, and track navigation buttons.
- **Gallery**: View images with left and right navigation buttons.
- **Calendar**: Displays a calendar on the screen.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Each screen has a back button to return to the main menu.
- **Fragments and ViewModel**: Used for managing screens and data sharing between components.
- **Debug Mode**: A switch to check the hand recognition system.
- **Cool Animations**: Smooth system animation effects for navigation.
- **App Download**: [Download GestureXpress](https://github.com/Lakshman-kumar-121/GestureXpress-KT/raw/main/Assets/GestureXpress.apk)

## Device Compatibility

GestureXpress was mainly created and tested on the IQOO Z7 Pro 5G mobile. There may be slight variances in performance and screen mapping on different devices.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements will include:
1. Different click events.
2. Inbuilt permission requests.
